You seek answers. 

You want a purpose and a point to it all. 

You say "What can I do to improve my life? What can I do to improve myself?" You look for a task to do that will change things, that will move you forward and make everything OK.

Everything is already OK.

Don't worry.

Don't look forward to a place in the future where you will have changed, and everything will be done. You will never be done.

Be content to grow.
